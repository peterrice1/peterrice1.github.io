The underwhelming start cannot be attributed to the defense, who has allowed the second-fewest points in the NFL this season. The offense, meanwhile, has struggled mightily with their new Signal-Caller. Part of the blame is on first-time head coach Nathaniel Hackett who was brought in for his offensive mindset, but Russell was ready to prove he could lead a new team and hasn’t lived up to the task.\n\n\nCode\nqb4 <- qb1  %>% \n  select(Player, TD, Int, `Cmp%`) %>%\n  group_by(Player) %>%\n  summarize(\n    TD,\n    Int,\n    `Cmp%`\n  ) %>%\n  select(Player, \n         TD,\n         Int,\n         `Cmp%` ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\ntop10 <-  qb4 %>% top_n(10, wt= TD)\nruss2 <- qb4 %>% filter(Player == \"Russell Wilson\")\ntop10plus <- bind_rows(top10, russ2)\n\ntop10plus%>% gt()%>% \n  cols_label(\n    Int = \"Interceptions\",\n    TD = \"Touchdowns\" ,\n    `Cmp%` = \"Completion %\"\n  ) %>%  \ntab_header(\n    title = \"Bottom of the Barrel\",\n    subtitle = \"Russ isn't putting up big numbers, and also has one of the lowest completion percentages in the NFL.\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Peter Rice  |  **Source:** Football-Reference \")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=13)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")%>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#002244\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#FB4F14\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Russell Wilson\")\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Cmp%`),\n      rows = `Cmp%` > 72\n    )\n   ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Int),\n      rows = Int <3\n    )\n   )%>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"green\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(TD),\n      rows = TD > 19\n    )\n   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Bottom of the Barrel\n    \n    \n      Russ isn't putting up big numbers, and also has one of the lowest completion percentages in the NFL.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Player\n      Touchdowns\n      Interceptions\n      Completion %\n    \n  \n  \n    Patrick Mahomes\n20\n5\n66.9\n    Josh Allen\n19\n6\n65.5\n    Joe Burrow\n17\n6\n69.2\n    Lamar Jackson\n15\n6\n63.0\n    Aaron Rodgers\n13\n4\n66.4\n    Geno Smith\n13\n3\n72.7\n    Jalen Hurts\n12\n2\n68.2\n    Jared Goff\n12\n6\n63.9\n    Justin Herbert\n12\n4\n65.9\n    Tua Tagovailoa\n12\n3\n69.9\n    Russell Wilson\n6\n4\n58.8\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Peter Rice  |  Source: Football-Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nHe will need to improve his play regardless, but his teams in the past consistently made deep playoff runs even when he was playing sub-par. Wilson has another great defense and suitable weapons at his side, so is it possible for him and the Broncos to turn it around?\n\n\nCode\nmrunl <- read_csv(\"mrunl - Sheet1.csv\")\nmrunl2 <- read_csv(\"mrunl2 - Sheet1.csv\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=mrunl2, aes(x=Year, y=TD), color=\"#FB4F14\") +\n  geom_point(data=mrunl2, aes(x=Year, y=TD), color=\"#002244\") +\nlabs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Passing Touchdowns\",\ntitle = \"Russell Wilson's Career Arc\",\nsubtitle = \"Unless there is a dramatic turnaround, this will be his worst statistical season yet\",\ncaption = \"Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com | By Peter Rice\", legend.position = \"none\") +\ntheme_minimal() + theme(\nplot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\naxis.title = element_text(size = 12),\naxis.text = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\") \n) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2014, y=18, label=\"Super Bowl Victory\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2020.64, y=12.75, label=\"Predicted Touchdowns\"), color=\"#002244\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=2022, y=14), color=\"#002244\") \n\n\n\n\n\nAs a career-low season is looming for Wilson, it’s unlikely for the Broncos to make any postseason noise if they make it at all. The organization echoed this belief on the trade deadline when they dealt away talented pass-rusher Bradley Chubb to the Dolphins for Chase Edmonds and a first-round pick in next year’s draft.\nWith 9 games remaining in the regular season, Russell and the Broncos have an uphill battle to avoid a seventh consecutive season missing the playoffs and their sixth straight losing season."
